# SQL-projects

This repository demonstrates skills in database design, SQL query writing, and using SQL for data analysis. Projects feature proficiency in conceptual data modeling, implementing normalized database structures, writing advanced SQL queries, and using SQL code to derive business insights from data. The repository reflects core competencies in database administration, complex query building, and leveraging SQL for impactful business intelligence.

Some projects are inspired by database design, queries, and techniques from online SQL learning resources. However, the SQL code presented here is my own work for developing proficiency, not copied content. The repository reflects my skills in modeling, managing, and transforming data with SQL.
